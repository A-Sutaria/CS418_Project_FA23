Each dataset is also divided into multiple data types across different geography values such as Metro & U.S, State, County, City, Zip Code and Neighbourhood. However, the issue we faced was that not all datasets have the each of the geography value except for Metro & U.S so we decided to mainly use the datasets which have the Metro & U.S values.\n",

    "If we look at the Bar chart plot, it is very obvious that there is a huge difference between the two groups: Houses with schools in the same neighborhood (ZIP Code), and Houses without schools in the same neighborhood (ZIP Code). It is observed that houses in the same ZIP Code region as a school had dramatically high Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) as of 09/30/2023 than those of houses in a ZIP Code region with no schools. This proves my hypothesis that there is a co-relation between houses and schools. The conclusion is that houses with schools nearby have a higher ZHVI. "
